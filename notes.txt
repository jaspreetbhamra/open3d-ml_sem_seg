Using cuda and automatic mixed precision
Open3D pytorch doesn't work with Windows, hence using wsl (Ubuntu)
Installed pytorch using the cuda requirements in the git repo
The sparseconv layer is present in open3d.ml.torch.layers and not in open3d.ml.torch.nn as is given in the documentation link provided in the mail
